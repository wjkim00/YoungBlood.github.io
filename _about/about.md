## Introduction
My name is Kim WonJin. I graduated with a master's degree, and my major is Computer Vision. The research field is autonomous driving, such as object detection/recognition, segmentation, and depth estimation, etc..  Also I can do machine/deep learning programming for high performance in computer vision. <br/>
However I'm working as a Software Engineer devloping SDKs or certain frameworks. It's a shame that I can't work in my major, but I think my programming skills have improved.

This blog was created to record my personal studies and projects. If you want to contact me, please check the my email in my profile on the side-bar.
